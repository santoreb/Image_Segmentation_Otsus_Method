# Image Segmentation using Otsu's Method
This code implements Otsu's Method for Image Segmentation described in this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076. The goal of this code is to calculate the threshold in the image gray scale that will detect the object and the background.
## Dataset
The dataset used to test the implementation of this method is the MNIST dataset, available as part of the torchvision library. More information on the dataset can be found here: https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
